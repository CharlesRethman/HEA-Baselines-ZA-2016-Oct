# HEA-Baselines-ZA-2016-Oct
Data and analysis for the baselines assessment exercise.

This is a complete set of documents, apart from the main Postgres database. Of particular interest, the following directories:

`./reports` - which contains the basline profiles, outcome statistics and presentations

`./graphics` - which contains map images and graph images

`./maps` - which contains QGIS map files

`./sql` - which contains the PostgreSQL files that extract or update relevant data on the database

A complete set of spreadsheets can be found in the `HEA-ZA-Spreadsheets` repository on GitHub.
